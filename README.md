# MedXNet-Deep-learning-model-for-x-ray-image-classification
MedXNet is a hybrid classification model made up off VGG-16 and Resnet50.
This a experimental model I made for my final year project in my uni, Basically my model using VGG-16 and Resnet50's Five convolutional layers, instead of 16 convolutional layer from VGG-16 and 50 from Resnet50. Which gives out ~90 percent accuracy in classifying the input x-ray image into 4 classes:
1. Viral Pneumonia
2. Bacterial Pneumonia
3. Tuberculosis
4. Healthy Lungs

I used two datasets from kaggle named: "TBX11K" and "Chest X-ray images" and augmentated the data to reduce class imbalance. I have uploaded my project report for further understanding of my project.
